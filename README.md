### Course Project 1

The script files and plots are provided. Please download/copy the data file in to working directory.

The file should be named "household_power_consumption.txt".

In case the file is not in the working directory, the scripts attemtp to download the zip file, and then unzip
it to get the file in the working directory.

To run the scripts, please do the following:

* Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to the working directory.

* Run the scripts

Note: The scripts attempt to load the file, but it is convenient to have the data file in the working directory
